Hi,
The main reason i am applying for the financial aid is due to the family commitments i have here. Due to which i will not be able o pay the course fee.
I know we can take courses online, but a course with the certification from a reputed university is something every employer/ company will be looking for.
Currently i am learning python online to understand the concepts. Also i have enrolled for a course of python in coursera.
I already have industry experience of 2.5 years in SAP field.
But my passion and goal is to learn python with datascience and machine learning and make a career out of it.
Certification from coursera in our CV will have very good weightage.
Also since my passion is towards learning, i will be taking this course very seriously. 
So that once i am completed with the course, i can switch company and also look for job in python with data science and machine learning.
Due to the family commitments i won't be able to save extra money to take any courses.
As i'm already aware of the concept of financial aid in courseera, this is the only oppurtunity for me take the course and get the certification as well.
